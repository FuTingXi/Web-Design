# 网页设计基于html+css+js / Web design based on html+css+js / การออกแบบเว็บโดยใช้ html+css+js

简单的自我介绍：在介绍这个简单的Web前端项目之前做一个简单的自我介绍。这门课是大二上学期开的，写这个README是在大二上学期结束的假期。记得大一下学期刚刚结束的那会，放假回家也没有出去找什么兼职，但就是不知道为什么，可能就突发的想法，找上一届的学长学姐要到了大二上学期的开课课表。然后把所有的专业课的课本买了回来，就开始自学了：
* 数据结构（刚开始接触数据结构那会直接给我劝退了，但大二上学期跟着老师学习结束，加上自学之后整理的笔记来看。其实也就那样吧哈哈哈。）
+ Web网页设计（这门课我觉得应该是最简单的一个课程了，记得大二上学期还没开学我就学完了html+css，js是后面开学在学校跟着老师慢慢学的。自己在家里也写了一些普普通通的小东西哈哈哈。在期末这门课也是拿到了满分的成绩。答辩也得到了老师的肯定，心里是非常开心的。这个项目就是当时得到了满分的Web项目。）
- 计算机组成原理（在学习这门课的时候，我也写了快一本笔记本的笔记关于计算机组成原理。我的感觉是，这门课理论比较多，你要记住的东西，以及你要会的计算会比较繁多，很伤脑筋。但比起数据结构我觉得计算机组成原理更简单一些。学了这门课最简单的，你总要会浮点数定点数的四则运算吧，海明码，CRC码以及后面的存储系统那些最基本的概念东西吧。和硬件的关联也很多。当时我们做的电路实验也很多，但是我在电路实验这一块确实很弱哈哈哈！）
* Python（这门课也是在我们大二上个学期开的课，因为有C语言的一定基础，我在学习这个课的时候不是那么的吃力，一些语法和C语言会有所不同哈哈。当时期末机考7个编程题写出了6个，有一个统计字典单词的个数，考试结束看答案一大堆代码，结果被我两行代码搞定了，哈哈哈。真的不是在吹嘘，真的很有成就感哈哈哈）
- **还有其他的课程学习就不一一和各位大佬列举了，还是言归正传来看这个Web项目哈哈哈。**

项目介绍：该项目是基于html+css+js，你别看这个项目的js占了大部分，但是因为有一个外部引入的js，所以看着js很多，其实没有多少啦。这个项目主要是写了很多动态的效果，比如走动的人，动态的自我介绍，一些3D效果，实时时间表盘，留言板，轮播图，新闻栏，锚点菜单，导航栏等等。时间长了我也记不得这么多啦。文件大多数我用英文命名的都是简单的单词，大家可以细细品味。**有需要的大佬们，懒得敲的大佬们可以直接复制拿走，开源就是为了共同学习哈哈哈。各个文件基本上我都是采用外链的方法方便提取下载哦。

A brief self-introduction: Before introducing this simple web front-end project, give a brief self-introduction. This course is offered in the first semester of my sophomore year, and I wrote this README during the vacation at the end of the first semester of my sophomore year. I remember when the first semester of my freshman year just ended, I went home for the holidays and didn’t go out to look for any part-time jobs. But I didn’t know why, so maybe I had a sudden idea and asked the seniors from the previous semester for the class schedule for the first semester of my sophomore year. . Then I bought all the textbooks for professional courses and started self-study:
* Data structure (When I first came into contact with data structure, I was immediately persuaded to give up, but I finished studying with the teacher in the first semester of my sophomore year, and looked at the notes compiled after self-study. In fact, it is like that, hahaha.)
+ Web page design (I think this course should be the easiest course. I remember that I finished learning html+css before the semester started in the first semester of my sophomore year. I learned js slowly from the teacher when I started school later. I was at home. I also wrote some ordinary little things, hahaha. At the end of the semester, I also got full marks for this course. The defense was also affirmed by the teacher, and I was very happy. This project was the Web project that got full marks at that time. )
- Principles of Computer Composition (While studying this course, I also wrote almost a notebook of notes about the principles of computer composition. My feeling is that this course has more theory, what you need to remember, and what you need to The calculations you need to know will be quite complex and very nerve-wracking. But I think the principles of computer composition are simpler than data structures. The easiest thing to learn after learning this course is that you must know the four arithmetic operations of floating-point and fixed-point numbers, Hamming code, CRC codes and the most basic concepts of the subsequent storage system. There are also many connections with hardware. We also did a lot of circuit experiments at that time, but I was really weak in circuit experiments hahaha!)
* Python (this course was also started in the last semester of our sophomore year. Because I have a certain foundation in C language, I didn’t have a hard time learning this course. Some of the grammar will be different from C language. Haha. At that time I wrote 6 of the 7 programming questions in the final computer-based exam, including one that counted the number of words in the dictionary. At the end of the exam, I looked at the answers to a lot of code, and I solved it with two lines of code, hahaha. I’m really not bragging, really. It’s a great sense of accomplishment hahaha)
- **There are other courses to study, so I won’t list them one by one with you guys. Let’s get back to the point and look at this Web project hahaha. **
- Project introduction: This project is based on html+css+js. Although js accounts for the majority of this project, because there is an externally introduced js, it seems that there is a lot of js, but in fact there is not much. This project mainly writes a lot of dynamic effects, such as walking people, dynamic self-introductions, some 3D effects, real-time timetable panels, message boards, carousels, news columns, anchor menus, navigation bars, etc. It’s been a long time and I can’t remember so much. Most of the files I named in English are simple words, so you can savor them carefully. **Big guys in need or too lazy to knock can just copy and take it away. The purpose of open source is to learn together hahaha. Basically, I use external links to facilitate extraction and downloading of each file.
